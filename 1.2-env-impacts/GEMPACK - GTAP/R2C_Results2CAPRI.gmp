! === Code to connect a GTAP based CGE to CAPRI  ============

Purpose: 
This program computes shares and variations of GTAP based CGE models 
that will be used as exogenous variables in CAPRI. 


Reference: Code is the GEMPACK translation of a BATModule resulting from 
work described in Torbj√∂rn Jansson & Houssein Guimbard (2023)" Interaction
between trade and environmental policy". D1.2. available at
https://www.batmodel.eu/d1-2-interaction-between-trade-and-environmental-policy/

Use: 
This code is run after a simulation using the standard GTAP v7 model, computing
coefficients from solution files. 

Note that coefficient names had to be shortened compared to the GAMS veriosn due to GEMPACK
length constraint. Also note that GTAP v7 has a distinction between activity and
commodities, allowing for joint production not allowed for in teh GAMS code.
Cost shares are define by activity while product prices are defined at commodity
level using appropriate variables from GTAP v7. The GEMPACK code is generalized
by not hardcoding 2030 as year for results but using a set PER with one
element and subset of all TIME periods easing a change of the code to other
years.

Code for reading data from different periods and scenarios is created in Gtree
using the @ function to generate code. For this to work properly take care that
the hardcoded set elments of TIME and SCEN match the include statements for @P
and @S.
 
The code requires for each scenario (see set SIM) and time period (see set
TIME) the following files/headers:
- File GTAPSETS # Standard GTAP sets file #;
- File RESULTS # Output file for use by CAPRI #;
- File DATA_@S@P: updated datafile by scenario (@S) and period (@P) with
  coefficients (headers) EVFP, VDFP, VMFP
- File SOL__@S@P: solution file (converted to har) with by scenario (@S) and period (@P) 
  with variables (headers) pint, pfe, pds
