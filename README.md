The overarching aim of the BATModel project (www.BATModel.eu) is to improve the modelling of agri-food policies in existing tools and approaches. This GitHUb project distributes **BATModules** which are model extensions provided as modular, well-documented pieces of code in the two main modelling languages (GAMS and GEMPACK). Our aim is to provide project advancements to the (trade) modelling community, extending the impact of the BATModel project beyond the project model teams and beyond the lifetime of the BATModel project.
